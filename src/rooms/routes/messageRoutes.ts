// Note: Messages here means messages that are sent to and from agents (room participants, GM, oracles, etc.) to the backend

// These are POST routes that participants can use instead of WS. Messages that are input through REST and WS are processed the exact same way.

// POST requests here should all implement the signatureAuth middleware to verify the message is coming from an authorized source.
